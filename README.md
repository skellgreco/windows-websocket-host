### 📜 How to run
- Clone the repo
- Run `npm i` to install required dependencies
- Run `npm run start` to launch the app

### 💻 Technologies used
- Electron
- `ws` library for WebSocket intialization
- `qrcode` library for qrcode generation
- `os` library for dynamic IP Fetching

### ❓ How does it work
Once the app launches, a simple UI is displayed with a button to *Start WebSocket Server*. Once clicked, the app is starting a WebSocket Server on port `6969` and on the best-performing IPv4 IP. Then, the UI displays the URL on which the Server is running on, and a URL which contains that IP for easy scanning for other devices. Also, the UI contains a section to display messages received from other websocket instances
